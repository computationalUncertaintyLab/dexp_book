    "## Two or more random variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A single random variable is a useful way to describe a sample space and the probabilities assigned to values on the number line corresponding to outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But more complicated scientific questions often require several random variables and rules for how they interact.\n",
    "We will explore how to generate multiple random variables  on the same sample space. \n",
    "Then we will develop an approach to define probabilities for combinations of random variables, a joint probability mass function and joint cumulative mass function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A new type of sample space\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we design a sample space $\\mathcal{S}$ and build two random variables on this space $X$ and $Y$.\n",
    "Because $X$ and $Y$ are random variables we can think of the support of $X$ and support of $Y$ as two new sample spaces. Lets assume that the outcomes in $supp(X) = \\{x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},\\cdots,x_{N}\\}$ and that the outcomes in $supp(Y) = \\{y_{1},y_{2},\\cdots,y_{M}\\}$. \n",
    "Then we can define a new set of outcomes in the space $supp(X) \\times supp(Y) = \\{x_{i}, y_{j}\\}$ for all combinations of $i$ from $1$ to $N$ and $j$ from $1$ to $M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This new space above maps outcomes in $\\mathcal{S}$ to a tuple $(x_{i},y_{j})$  where the outcomes were mapped by $X$ to the value $x_{i}$ and by $Y$ to the value $y_{j}$. \n",
    "If we assign the probability of $(x_{i},y_{j})$ to be the the sum of the probabilities of all outcomes in $\\mathcal{S}$ that $X$ maps to $x_{i}$ and $Y$ maps to $y_{i}$ then we call this a **joint probability distribution**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example** A pharmaceutical company launches a clinical trial to study adverse events from a novel medicine. The trial enrolls patients and randomizes them to receive the novel drug or optimal medical therapy. The trial expects three potential adverse events which we call $\\text{ae}_{1}$, $\\text{ae}_{2}$, and $\\text{ae}_{3}$.\n",
    "We may choose to define a sample space $\\mathcal{S} = \\{(\\text{nov},\\text{ae}_{1}),(\\text{nov},\\text{ae}_{2}),(\\text{nov},\\text{ae}_{3}),(\\text{omt},\\text{ae}_{1}),(\\text{omt},\\text{ae}_{2}),(\\text{omt},\\text{ae}_{3})\\}$ and further build a random variable $X$ that maps outcomes to values 0 when an adverse event was experienced by a control patient and 1 when an adverse event was experienced by a novel drug patient, and a random variable $Y$ that maps adverse event 1 to the value 1, adverse event 2 to the value 2, and adverse event 3 to the value 3.\n",
