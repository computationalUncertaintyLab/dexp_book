    "We define a **set** as a collection of items, sometimes called elements. A set is typically given a capital letter (for example $A$) and the elements are included inside curly braces.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use $\\mathcal{G}$ to define the set of all possible outcomes from an experiment and call this set the **sample space**.\n",
    "The term *\"experiment\"* has a broad meaning.\n",
    "An experiment can mean everything from a randomized controlled trial to an observational study.\n",
    "Experiments are what produce observations that we collect and try to characterize.\n",
    "Here an **experiment** is the process that generates outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **outcome** is defined as an element of the sample space, some result of the experiment that is recorded.\n",
    "An outcome is a single observation from an experiment, and we define an **event** as a set, or group, of outcomes.\n",
    "Most often we use $o_{i}$ to denote an outcome and $E_{i}$ to denote an event.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample space, event, and outcome are all potential results from an experiment.\n",
    "When we conduct an experiment we will generate an outcome from our sample space and call this realized outcome a **data point**.\n",

    "*Example: Flipping a coin*\n",
    "Consider the experiment of flipping a coin and recording whether the coin lands heads or tails side up.  \n",
    "We can define a sample space $\\mathcal{G} = \\{H,T\\}$ where $H$ is an outcome that represents the coin landing heads up and $T$ represents tails up. \n",
    "The sample space includes all the possible events we wish to record, either the coin lands heads or it lands tails.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Up until this point we have structured our experiment, but we have not generated data.\n",
    "We flip the coin and the coin lands tails side up. Now we have performed an experiment and generated the data point $T$.\n",
    "We flip again and record a heads. $H$ is the second data point, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "Now suppose that we conduct an experiment with the same sample space $(\\mathcal{G})$ a number $N$ times and with each experiment we record a data point.\n",
    "A tuple (i.e. ordered list) of data points $d$ is called a **data set** $\\mathcal{D} = (d_{1}, d_{2}, d_{3}, \\cdots, d_{N})$ where $d_{i}$ is the data point generated from the $i^\\text{th}$ experiment.\n",
    "We say that we have _drawn_ or that we have _sampled_ a data set $\\mathcal{D}$.\n",
    "Further, data points $(d)$ are often called _realized_ outcomes because they are no longer in a set of potential possibilities but are now determined items.\n",
    "\n",
    "A data set $\\mathcal{D}$ can be unwieldy depending on the number of data points, the complexity of the sample space, or both.\n",
    "A **data frame** is one way to organize a data set.\n",
    "A data frame $\\mathcal{F}$ is a table where each data point $d$ in a dataset $\\mathcal{D}$ is represented as a row in the table.\n",
    "Each data point may contains multiple pieces of information.\n",
    "That is, each data point may itself be a tuple. \n",

    "We decide to collect from each human whether they are an expert in the modeling of infectious disease, a prediction of incident cases, and a prediction of incident deaths.\n",
