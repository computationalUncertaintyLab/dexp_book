    "## Exploratory vs Confirmatory data analysis \n",
    "Exploratory data analysis (**EDA**) is the study of: the potential for data to answer hypotheses and how to generate novel hypotheses by the study of relationships between collected information.\n",
    "This is in contrast to confirmatory data analysis. \n",
    "Confirmatory data analysis techniques are hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, statistical estimators---methods by which we seek to understand all possible experiments by observing a smaller number of experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both analyses are important. We will start with EDA. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition of an Experiment \n",
    "\n",
    "An experiment is any process that generates an observation. \n",
    "An observation can be measured and this measurement, or data, can be classified into one of several types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "Observations can be classified into: names, grades, ranks, fractions and percentages, counts, amounts, and balances.  \n",
    "This classification system is called the *Mosteller-Tukey* classification system.\n",
    "There exist other systems and *Stevens Typology*---classifying data as nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio---is another popular choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Amounts and Counts:\n",
    "Both amounts and counts are non-negative values without a necessary upper bound. \n",
    "Amounts are real-valued and counts are integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Balances:\n",
    "Balances are observations that can be positive or negative real values. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Counted Fractions and Percentages:\n",
    "Counted fractions are values $x/y$ where $x$ and $y$ are integers and $x \\leq y$.\n",
    "Percentages are any real value between 0 and 100.\n",
    "Importantly, both counted fractions and percentages are bounded. \n",
    "Fractions are bounded between 0 and 1, and percentages between 0 and 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grades, Ranks, and Names\n",
    "In the *Mosteller-Tukey* classification system there also exist: Names, Grades, and Ranks. \n",
    "We are less likely to use these data classifications in this course, but they should still be briefly discussed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data that can be 'Graded' can be assigned one of set of levels.\n",
    "These levels are sorted such that when you compare two graded observations you can say that one observation is 'higher' or 'larger' than the other. \n",
    "A set of $N$ observations can be ranked if each observation can be assigned an integer from 1 to N such that an observation with rank $x$ is larger than an observation with rank $y$ is $x>y$. \n",
    "Named data cannot be compared to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Descriptive Statistics \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of descriptive statistics are to characterize a set of observations, or pairs of observations with a smaller set of numbers. \n",
    "Though there is a loss of information by describing a set of $N$ observations by a smaller $n<N$ set of numbers, \n",
    "descriptive statistics can help us quickly understand our the data that we have collected and what we can do with this data. Common descriptive statistics are the mean, median, standard deviation etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Measures of Central Tendancy \n",
    "\n",
    "A measure of central tendency aims to use a single value to describe where observations are most probable.\n",
    "For <u>counted data</u>, a natural measure of central tendency is the **mode**.\n",
    "Given a dataset of $n$ observations, $\\mathcal{D} = (d_{1}, d_{2}, \\cdots, c_{n})$ the **mode** is the most frequently occurring value. \n",

    "The dataset is stored such that each row is an observation of a crowd accident. \n",
    "The observation has several pieces of information. \n",
