    "1. Let $X \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(0.2)$\n",

    "4. A new vaccine for a contagious disease is tested, and the probability that a vaccinated person does not get infected upon exposure is **0.9**. If a person is vaccinated and exposed to the disease, what is the probability that they:  \n",
    "   1. Get infected?  \n",
    "   2. Do not get infected?\n",

    "**Binomial**\n",

    "5. Define a random variable $R$ with a binomial distribution $(R \\sim \\text{Bin}(10,0.2))$.\n",
    "    1. Compute $\\mathbb{E}(R)$\n",
    "    2. Compute $V(R)$\n",
    "    3. Describe to someone who may not have statistical expertise what $P(R=3)$ means? Be sure to include assumptions about the Binomial distribution and how the parameters $N,\\theta$ relate to this probability.\n",
    "    4. For what value of $\\theta$ is $V(R)$ the highest? Why does this make sense intuitively?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In a town where **10%** of the population is susceptible to a new flu strain, **15 people** are randomly selected. Let **X** be the number of susceptible individuals in this group. From previous analysis, if more than 70\\% of the population is susceptible to this disease then there will likely be a massive outbreak. Compute:  \n",
    "   a) The probability that exactly **3** people are susceptible.  \n",
    "   b) The probability that at most **2** people are susceptible.  \n",
    "   c) The expected number of susceptible individuals.\n",
    "   d) Please run another analysis using the binomial distribution and discuss what you would communicate to experts in the study of this new flu strain?  \n",
    "   \n",
    "7. Suppose you decide to develop a model for how the number of infections propoate over time in a finite population where no travel is allowe into or out of the system. You define a series of random variables $I_{t}$ that describe the number of infected individuals (called infectors) at time $t$. The model you decide on is\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    I_{t+1} \\sim \\text{Binomial}(S_{t}, 1 - (1-p)^{i_{t}})\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $S_{t}$ is the number of individuals susceptible to disease at time $t$, $p$ is probability that an infector passes their pathogen to a susceptible individual upon contact, and $i_{t}$ is the observed number of infectors at time $t$.   \n",
    "    1. Please compute an expression for the number of infected individuals at time $t+1$\n",
    "    2. We know that for $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N,\\theta)$ when $N=1$ the Binomial distributions reduces to the Bernoulli distribution. Using this idea, can you please reason about what $1-(1-p)^{t_{t}}$ is describing?\n",
    "    3. Let there be 10,000 susceptibles individuals and 10 infectors at time $t$. Let $p$=0.02. Please compute $P( I_{t+1} > 10 )$ and provide an explain what information that probability is communicating to you? \n",

    "9. The number of patients arriving at a hospital’s emergency room follows a Poisson distribution with an average of **5 arrivals per hour**.\n",

    "    2. What is the probability that at least **150** patients arrive in the next *day*?\n",

    "10. We wish to compute the probability of an event on a continuous time interval, rather than a discrete interval. Define a time interval that starts at zero and ends at $T$, break that interval into pieces of wideth $h$, and then define a random variable $Y \\sim \\text{Geometric}( p \\cdot h )$.\n",
    "    1. If we divide the interval from 0 to $t$ into pieces of size $h$ then please express the number of pieces in terms of $h$ and of the length of this interval.\n",
    "    2. Write down the probability mass function for $Y$ and reason what would happen to this pmf as $h \\to 0$. In other words, evaluate $ \\lim_{h \\to 0} f_{Y}(y) $.\n",
    "    3. Use this new probability mass function that you derived above to compute the probability that, given $p=1/2$ and $t=10$, $P(Y < 1)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "11. A clinic tests individuals for a disease where **10% of tests come back positive**. If patients are tested one at a time, what is the probability that:  \n",
    "    1. The first positive test occurs on the **3rd** test?  \n",
    "    2. The first positive test occurs **before the 5th test**?\n",

    "12. Given a random variable $X$, the cumualative distribution function is defined as $F_{X}(x) = P(X \\leq x)$. Lets consider the dataset generated below called $d$. This is a list of 1000 values.\n",
    "    1. Lets estimate the cdf at value $x$ as the number of data points less than or equal to the value $x$ divided by the number of data points. Create a python function that inputs the value $x$ and returns an estimate of the cdf.\n",
    "    2. Find the minimum $x$ from $d$, called $x_{\\text{min}}$ and the maximum $x$ from $d$, called $x_{\\text{max}}$ and use the function above to plot $(x, F_{X}(x))$ for 100 values between $x_{\\text{min}}$ and $x_{\\text{max}}$"
