    "We use the symbol $\\in$ to express that an element \"is a member of\" a set.  \n",
    "For example, $a \\in A$ can be read \"the element $a$ is a member of the set $A$\" or \"the element $a$ is in the set $A$.\"  \n",

    "### The datapoint, dataset, and dataframe\n",

    "When we conduct an experiment we will generate an outcome from our sample space and call this realized outcome a **data point**. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*  Consider the experiment of flipping a coin and recording whether the coin lands heads or tails side up.\n",
    "We can define a sample space $ \\mathcal{S} = \\{H,T\\}$ where $H$ is an outcome that represents the coin landing heads up and $T$ represents tails up. Up until this point we have structured our experiment, but we have generated no data. We flip the coin and the coin lands tails side up. Now we have performed an experiment and generated the data point $T$.\n",

    "Now suppose that we conduct an experiment with the same sample space $( \\mathcal{S})$ a number $N$ times and with each experiment we record a data point. A tuple of data points $d$ is called a **data set** $\\mathcal{D} = (d_{1}, d_{2}, d_{3}, \\cdots, d_{N})$ where $d_{i}$ is the data point generated from the $i^\\text{th}$ experiment.\n",
    "We say that we have \\underline{drawn} or that we have \\underline{sampled} a data set $\\mathcal{D}$. Further, data points $(d)$ are often called \\underline{realized} outcomes because they are no longer in a set of potential possibilities but are now determined items. \n",
    "\n",
    "A data set $\\mathcal{D}$ can be unwieldy depending on the number of data points, the complexity of the sample space, or both.\n",

We decide to collect from each human whether they are an expert in the modeling of infectious disease,  a prediction of incident cases, and a prediction of incident deaths.
